# Smart White Cane

A fully functional white cane (also known as blindstick) was designed to aid the blind. It could detect any obstacle within a 6 feet distance and the stick would vibrate alerting the user. The vibrations will be omni-directional. The smart cane also consisted of a emergency button, which can send an emergency call and a text message consisting of the current location (latitutde and longitude) to a concerned individual.
